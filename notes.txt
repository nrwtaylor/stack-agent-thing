Install Gearman
https://gist.github.com/himelnagrana/9758209

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install gcc autoconf bison flex libtool make libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl libevent-dev uuid-dev

cd ~

wget https://launchpad.net/gearmand/1.2/1.1.12/+download/gearmand-1.1.12.tar.gz

tar -xvf gearmand-1.1.12.tar.gz

cd gearmand-1.1.12

./configure

sudo make

sudo make install

sudo apt-get install gearman-job-server

sudo pecl install gearman

sudo nano /etc/php5/conf.d/gearman.ini [and then write extension=gearman.so as content of the file, save it and close it]

sudo service apache2 restart

-

Needed apt-get install gperf

Then ./configure etc.

sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net

https://hasin.me/2013/10/30/installing-gearmand-libgearman-and-pecl-gearman-from-source/

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
wget https://launchpad.net/gearmand/1.2/1.1.11/+download/gearmand-1.1.11.tar.gz
tar -zxvf gearmand-1.1.11.tar.gz
cd gearmand-1.1.11
./configure
[/sourcecode]

Failure 1:
At this step, configure stopped showing the following error

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
configure: error: cannot find Boost headers version >= 1.39.0
[/sourcecode]

To fix this, I had to install “libboost-all-dev” by following command
[sourcecode language=”shell”]
apt-get install libboost-all-dev
[/sourcecode]

And I tried to compile gearman and it failed again

Failure 2:
At this step, configure stopped showing that it cannot find gperf. That’s fine – I have installed gperf and tried to configure gearman again

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
apt-get install gperf
[/sourcecode]

Failure 3:
Now it failed again, showing that libevent is missing. Hmm! Had to fix it anyway

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
apt-get install libevent-dev
[/sourcecode]

Failure 4:
Heck! Another failure. Now it’s showing that it can’t find libuuid. This part was a little tricky to solve, but finally fixed with the following package

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
apt-get install uuid-dev
[/sourcecode]

Let’s configure again. And sweet that the configure script ran smoothly. Let’s compile using make

Failure 5:
Grrr! At this point the make script failed with a bunch of text, where the following lines were at the top

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
libgearman/backtrace.cc: In function ‘void custom_backtrace()’:
libgearman/backtrace.cc:64:6: sorry, unimplemented: Graphite loop optimizations can only be used if the libcloog-ppl0 package is installed
[/sourcecode]

So it cannot find a library named libcloog-ppl. Let’s fix this problem by

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
apt-get install libcloog-ppl-dev
[/sourcecode]

Now I’ve tried to run the make script, and it was good. So i also ran make install to complete the installation.

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
make
make install
[/sourcecode]

Now gearmand and libgearman both are installed. So I tried to install pecl-gearman with the following extension and voila! it worked. No more missing libgearman anymore.

[sourcecode language=”shell”]
pecl install gearman
[/sourcecode]

Now all I had to do is add the line “extension=gearman.so” in my php.ini .

The process was tedious and boring and took me more time than writing this article. If you have seen “Despicable Me 2” when Lucy and Gru went to ElMacho’s restaurant and were attacked by that crazy chicken and finally Lucy exclaimed “What’s wrong with that chicken!”

I really wanted to say “What’s wrong with this chicken” after gearman was installed at last.

Enjoy!

Setting permissions on symlinks.  
This should only be an issue on this deployment of the framework.

Add template files ... there are sample index, thing (and eventually email)
templates in there.

cd /var/www/stackr.test
cp -r /var/www/stackr.test/vendor/nrwtaylor/stackr/templates templates

Or make your own.
Thing takes the $thing_report and display it.
Index is a standalone non db page.  With no thing access


---

Copy in resource files ... there are sample resource files for 
some of the agents provided.

cd /var/www/stackr.test  
cp -r /var/www/stackr.test/vendor/nrwtaylor/stackr/resources resources


--- Now get the Clock ticking
sudo crontab -e

Copy and paste this in as the last line.
* * * * * cd /var/www/stackr.test && /usr/bin/php -q /var/www/stackr.test/vendor/nrwtaylor/stackr/agents/Cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1

Watch the database for Cron things.
And then check the error logs :/
grep CRON /var/log/syslog

If you run into trouble, test this bit out.  For the correct absolute paths.
Test this bit
/usr/bin/php -q /var/www/stackr.test/vendor/nrwtaylor/stackr/agents/Cron.php

Once ticking, you'll see a cron tick every 60s.
